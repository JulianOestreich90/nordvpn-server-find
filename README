Small script to find the fastest NordVPN servers, filtering by
location and current capacity (i.e. server load).

Super useful if you use a third-party VPN client (like Viscosity)
and want to quickly find out the fastest server to connect to.

The script calls an undocumented NordVPN API endpoint for quick and
reliable results.

USAGE

nordvpn-server-find -l <location> -c <capacity> -n <limit>

<location>   2-letter ISO 3166-1 country code (ex: us, uk, de)
<capacity>   integer between 1-100 (defaults to 30)
<limit>   integer between 1-100 (defaults to 20)

DEPENDENCIES

- Bash 4
- jq 1.5
